# [Ecosyste.ms: dependabot](https://dependabot.ecosyste.ms)

An open index of Dependabot pull requests and security advisories across open source projects, providing insights into dependency update patterns and security vulnerability management.

## What is this?

This service tracks and analyzes Dependabot pull requests across GitHub repositories, helping package maintainers, security researchers, and developers understand:

- **Dependency Update Patterns**: Which packages are being updated most frequently, what types of updates are common (major, minor, patch), and which repositories are keeping their dependencies current
- **Security Advisory Coverage**: Which security vulnerabilities are being addressed by Dependabot PRs, tracking the relationship between published advisories (CVEs, GHSAs) and automated dependency updates
- **Ecosystem Health**: Adoption patterns of dependency management across different programming language ecosystems

## Who is this useful for?

### Package Maintainers
- **Track downstream adoption**: See which repositories are receiving Dependabot PRs for your packages
- **Monitor update patterns**: Understand how quickly the community adopts new versions of your packages
- **Security impact assessment**: Identify which security advisories affect your packages and track remediation

### Security Researchers
- **Vulnerability landscape**: Analyze how security advisories propagate through the open source ecosystem
- **Response time analysis**: Study how quickly vulnerabilities are addressed through automated dependency updates
- **Impact assessment**: Understand the blast radius of security vulnerabilities across projects

### DevOps & Security Teams
- **Dependency intelligence**: Research packages before adoption by understanding their update frequency and security history
- **Benchmark practices**: Compare your dependency management practices against similar projects
- **Supply chain insights**: Track security advisories and their resolution across your technology stack

## Key Features

- **Package Search**: Find packages and explore their Dependabot activity across repositories
- **Security Advisory Tracking**: Browse security advisories and see which Dependabot PRs address them
- **Analytics**: View trends in dependency updates, merge rates, and security response times
- **Cross-references**: Link between packages, repositories, issues, and security advisories
- **REST API**: Programmatic access to all data for integration with your tools
- **RSS Feeds**: Subscribe to real-time updates for specific packages, repositories, or global activity
